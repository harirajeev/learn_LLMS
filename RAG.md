-  <b> Two stage retrieval process </b>
   -   Retrieval stage - The first stage uses embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value to maximize recall while accepting a lower precision.
       -   Maximize recall while accepting a lower precision
       -   High recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).
       -   Initial high-recall stage handle the variations in the ways humans speak and write,
   -   [Reranking Stage](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/rag/rerankers/) - Second stage uses a slightly more computationally expensive process that is higher precision and lower recall (for instance with BM25) to “rerank” the existing retrieved candidates.
       -   Higher precision and lower recall
       -   Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones
       -   High-precision stage to accurately reflect the importance of relevance from things like phrases.

- RAG Use Case
     - 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗮𝘀𝗲:  A research company wants to enable their clients  ask queries against the research documents published by them. To leverage the power of longer contexts, they would have to train (not fine-tune) models on their proprietary data. This can be very pricey even with 2K. btw, 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝟲𝟱𝗕 𝗟𝗟𝗮𝗠𝗔 on 100K would cost ~$150M.
     - How can we build the same claim processing app w/o expensive training:  Enter Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
     - Here is the step by step:
         1. Chunk, embed, & index documents in VectorDBs (Vdb) like Weaviate or Pinecone
         2. Match the query embedding of the client.
         3. Retrieve the relevant context from Vdb.
         4. Do RAG using pre-trained LLMs such as Google's PaLM or OpenAI's GPTx.

         1. Flexibility:  What if a client is not authorized to see certain documents ?You need a Role-Based Authorization Control (RBAC). It is easier to do RBAC with a RAG solution.
         2. Practicality: It is easier to index new docs in VDBs, but retraining is expensive.
         3. Broader Coverage: Only Information Extraction cases necessitate longer contexts. if you dodge that with RAG, for other uses you can use fine-tuning with a shorter context.
         4. Interpretability: Retriever knows the exact documents.
     - Embedding model that can handle longer documents?
         - Owing to self-attention’s quadratic time and space complexity there will always be a context limitation original BERT had 512.
         - But the practical problem is there is no guarantee one model will handle all document lengths. There will always be outliers in spite of you throwing a boatload of money on say 2048 context still it’s not comprehensive.
         - So a better solution is to chunk documents and store them with smaller context-length models. You could save on storage costs and retrieval time.
     - When dealing with a vast corpus, beyond the embedding retrievals, a retrieval and re-ranking method is generally recommended and or maximal marginal relevance (MMR) criterion on all the document candidates.
