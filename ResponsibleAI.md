- Key aspects of responsible AI
  - Fairness / Bias
    -  mitigation
      - preprocessing (re-weighting)
      - Inprocessing (Adversarial debiasing)
      - Postprocessing (Decision Threshold, Rejection option classification)
      - Fairness thru unawareness
  -  Explainability / Interpretability
      -  Post-hoc - explain a given AI model
          - individual prediction explaination of input features / influentual examples / concepts / local decision rules
          - global prediction explanation - partial dependency plots / global feaure importance / global decision rules
      - build an interpretable model - logistic regression / decision trees / GAMs
      - LIME (local interpretable model - agmostic explanations) / SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) shapley values
      - GradCAM (Gradient weighted class activation mapping)
  -  Robustness
      - model behaving differentialy under different setting - shift in the distribution of data
      - representative data
      - monitoring
      - adversarial training
  -  Privacy
      - private data should remain private
      - de-identification
      - anonymization
      - Re-identifiction risk, model inversion attacks
      - differential privacy
      - k-anonymity
      - federated learning 
  -  Security
      - how is sensitive data protected ?
      - effective cyber security techniques
      - adversarial attacks / adversarial training / gradient masking  
  -  Transparency
      -  model cards - how was the model built / data used etc
      -  data cards - how was the data created
  -  Accountability
-  Regulations
  -  DPDP Act
  -  GDPR
  -  EU AI Act
  -  US Regulation
  -  Ethical approvals
  -  Informed consent
  -  participatory design
  -  Future of work
