- Key aspects of responsible AI
  - Fairness / Bias
    -  mitigation
      - preprocessing (re-weighting)
      - Inprocessing (Adversarial debiasing)
      - Postprocessing (Decision Threshold, Rejection option classification)
      - Fairness thru unawareness
  -  Explainability / Interpretability
      -  Post-hoc - explain a given AI model
          - individual prediction explaination of input features / influentual examples / concepts / local decision rules
          - global prediction explanation - partial dependency plots / global feaure importance / global decision rules
      - build an interpretable model - logistic regression / decision trees / GAMs
      - LIME (local interpretable model - agmostic explanations) / SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) shapley values
      - GradCAM (Gradient weighted class activation mapping)
  -  Robustness
      - model behaving differentialy under different setting - shift in the distribution of data
  -  Privacy
  -  Security
  -  Transparency
  -  Accountability
