  - Why is it hard to run inference for large language models ? There are 2 main factors contributing to the inference challenge
    1. Large Memoryfoot print
      - Both model parameters and intermediate states are needed in memory at inference time.
        - The KV cache should be stored in memory during decoding time. Eg: for a batch size of 512 and context length of 2048. The KV cache totals 3TB, that is 3X the model size
        - Inference cost from the attention mechanism scales quadratically with input sequence length
    2. Low parallelizability. Inference generation is executed in an autoregressive fashion, making the decoding process hard to parallel.
