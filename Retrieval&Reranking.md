-  <b> Two stage retrieval process </b>
   -   Retrieval stage - The first stage uses embedding-based retrieval with a high top-k value to maximize recall while accepting a lower precision.
       -   Maximize recall while accepting a lower precision
       -   High recall means that an algorithm returns most of the relevant results (whether or not irrelevant ones are also returned).
       -   Initial high-recall stage handle the variations in the ways humans speak and write,
   -   [Reranking Stage](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/rag/rerankers/) - Second stage uses a slightly more computationally expensive process that is higher precision and lower recall (for instance with BM25) to “rerank” the existing retrieved candidates.
       -   Higher precision and lower recall
       -   Higher precision means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones
       -   High-precision stage to accurately reflect the importance of relevance from things like phrases.
