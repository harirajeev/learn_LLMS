Hidden technical Debt in GenAI Systems
- technical debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing a quick and potentially dirty solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
- Itâ€™s the trade-off between speed and perfection.
- While it might be tempting to cut corners to meet deadlines or achieve short-term goals, the long-term consequences can be significant. 
- This includes increased maintenance costs, reduced agility, potential security vulnerabilities, and overall system instability.
- accruing technical debt is a strategic decision. For instance, a startup might decide to incur some technical debt to quickly launch a product and gain market share, with the intention of addressing the debt once the product is stable.
- The key is to be aware of the technical debt being accrued, understand its implications, and have a plan to address it in the future.
- Just as financial debt can be managed with regular payments and a clear repayment plan, technical debt can be managed with regular code refactoring and architectural reviews.
